# A tool for scraping images 
This tool is made for download img by keyword searching from inst\*gr\*m.  
It's prohibited to scrape from inst\*gr\*m so if you want to use this tool,  
I will not bear any responsibility whatsoever.

## Usage
`python -m scrape.core`  
`Enter keyword of images --> [keyword of image that you want]`
